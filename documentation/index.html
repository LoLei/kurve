        <h2>Game idea</h2>
        <p>
            Kurve is a networked multiplayer game based on modern web technologies. The game is based on the popular DOS
            game 'Achtung die Kurve'. Each player can control one line using the arrow keys or a gamepad. The goal of the
            game is to maneuver the line without crashing into other lines or the border.

        <h2>Client-server architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Kurve is based on two servers and multiple clients. The servers are implemented in python and the clients run
          in the player's browser.
        </p>

        <h3>HTTP server</h3>
        <p>
          The first server is a HTTP server and is responsible for the initial delivery of the files (html, js, css). It
          has no further tasks during the game.
        </p>

        <h3>Websocket server</h3>
        <p>
          The second server is a websocket server. After loading the files the clients connect to the websocket server
          and keep the connection open for further communication. The websocket server stores no data apart from
          necessary information about the currently conntected clients (for example the number of clients, or the open
          websocket connections). The websocket server's task is to forward messages from one client to the other clients.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>MVC architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The client code is separated into model, view and controller. In order to structure the code and increase
          maintainability the client code is separated into various files, based on the responsibility of the code.
        </p>
